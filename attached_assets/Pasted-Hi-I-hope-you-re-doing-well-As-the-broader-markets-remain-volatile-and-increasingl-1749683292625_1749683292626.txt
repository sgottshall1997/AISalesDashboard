Hi ____________ – I hope you're doing well.
 
As the broader markets remain volatile and increasingly narrow in leadership, 13D Research continues to help investors navigate with clarity. Our highest-conviction themes - rooted in secular shifts we have been closely monitoring - are now outperforming dramatically. Our Highest Conviction Ideas portfolio is up 19.6% YTD, outpacing the S&P 500 by over 20%. We believe these shifts are still in the early innings.
 
Below are some of the most compelling insights we’ve recently shared with clients, along with key investment implications:
 
Gold’s Historic Breakout:
Gold has surged past a 45-year downtrend when measured against CPI, with junior gold miners now outperforming seniors (a bullish inflection that has historically signaled massive upside).
Our 13D Gold Miners Index is up over 55% YTD as we are focused on nimble producers with upside from consolidation potential.
 
Commodities Supercycle Broadens:
Breakouts in copper, silver, fertilizers, and even coal point to a new phase of this uptrend. Our overweight to commodity-linked equities continues to deliver alpha amid declining USD and rising inflation expectations.
Agriculture, energy storage, and hard asset producers are all key focuses.
 
Grid Infrastructure: The $21 Trillion Opportunity:
Power outages are rising worldwide, and demand from AI, EVs, and Bitcoin mining is pushing grids past their limits, with over $21 trillion in grid investment needed by 2050 - providing a generational opportunity across copper, batteries, and high-voltage equipment.
We are focused on manufacturers of grid infrastructure, battery storage systems, and companies enabling smart grid digitization.
 
Critical Minerals: The Geopolitical Pressure Point:
China's dominance over the rare-earth supply chain has become a strategic lever of geopolitical power, with export controls threatening US weapons systems, semiconductors, and clean tech.
The US is 100% import-reliant for 12 critical minerals and lacks refining capacity, leaving supply chains dangerously exposed.
Our 13D Critical Minerals Index (focused on Western producers) is already outperforming as global investment pours into securing mine independence.
 
Bitcoin’s Evolving Use Case:
Bitcoin is undergoing a quiet transformation as Layer-2 innovation and DeFi infrastructure (BTCFi) are unlocking new functionality beyond simply “digital gold.”
As Bitcoin becomes a platform for smart contracts, lending, and NFTs, it could drive a new wave of demand and broader adoption.
We closely monitor Bitcoin’s technical positioning to identify when it is overbought or oversold—giving clients a tactical edge - for example, we started to exit bitcoin after its run up late last year, then re-entered the position in April as conditions reset.
This disciplined approach enables us to capitalize on volatility while managing risk.
 
If you are interested in learning more about what we are closely monitoring and how we are allocating across these themes, I’d be happy to set up a call to discuss.
 
Best,
Spencer
