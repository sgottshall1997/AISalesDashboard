Hi Monica,

I hope this message finds you well at W-GEM. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions, particularly given your interests in markets, geopolitics, and precious metals. I’ve been reviewing some insightful reports that align closely with your focus areas and could offer strategic value to your investment considerations.

One of the reports, “Strategy & Asset Allocation & Performance of High Conviction Ideas,” provides a comprehensive analysis of market shifts. Article 1, for instance, highlights a paradigm shift towards commodities and inflation-sensitive sectors, driven by rising bond yields and a weakening U.S. dollar. Specifically, it notes the breakout of the gold-to-U.S. CPI ratio from a 45-year downtrend, signaling a favorable environment for gold and silver, which are sectors you are keenly interested in. This could be an opportune time to consider increasing exposure to gold miners and silver, as these are outperforming major global indices.

In Article 2, titled “In the last two weeks, we were in China. Here is what we learned,” the focus is on China’s strategic geopolitical maneuvers amid global trade tensions. The report describes China’s preparedness for high tariffs and its strategic diversification of trading relationships. This geopolitical resilience, along with a rise in domestic economic stimulus, suggests that Chinese equities could be a promising area for investment. Such dynamics could align well with W-GEM’s strategic interest in geopolitics.

Furthermore, Article 3 on “The risks to the USD Index are mounting” outlines potential challenges for the U.S. dollar due to weaker growth and rising inflation expectations. The article discusses the implications of a potential "revenge tax" on foreign holders of U.S. assets, which could further bolster the case for investing in precious metals as a hedge. This aligns with your interest in maintaining a cautious yet strategic portfolio stance.

These insights could be pivotal in shaping investment strategies that leverage current market dynamics while aligning with your areas of interest. If these topics resonate with your current objectives, I’d be happy to delve deeper into each aspect or search for any other relevant reports you may be interested in.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
