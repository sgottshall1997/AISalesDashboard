## 🧪 Example Output (Using Your Inputs)

**📌 Title:**  
Uranium Overview

**👥 Target Audience:**  
Portfolio Managers

**📄 Executive Summary:**  
Uranium markets are entering a new structural phase driven by accelerating demand for energy security and clean baseload power. Recent price action confirms a breakout from multi-year resistance, with demand growth outpacing supply in key geographies. For PMs, this theme offers asymmetric upside with manageable tail risk if properly positioned.

**📈 Growth Drivers:**  
- Global nuclear restarts are accelerating — Japan, South Korea, and France are reactivating dormant capacity (WILTW_2025-05-29)  
- Supply remains constrained due to underinvestment and geopolitics in key producer regions (Kazakhstan, Niger)  
- Sprott Physical Uranium Trust continues to absorb spot supply, tightening the market further  
- U.S. legislative support (e.g. $4.3B in strategic reserve commitments) is providing regulatory tailwind

**⚠️ Risk Landscape:**  
- Enrichment bottlenecks could delay utility procurement cycles  
- Negative media/political events may cause short-term sentiment drawdowns  
- Global macro slowdown could pressure uranium equities even if spot holds firm

**✅ Portfolio Takeaways:**  
- Build exposure to top-tier uranium producers with cost discipline and long-life assets  
- Consider adding physical uranium proxies (e.g. Sprott URA) to hedge equity volatility  
- Stay nimble on micro-cap names; treat them as tactical positions, not core holdings
