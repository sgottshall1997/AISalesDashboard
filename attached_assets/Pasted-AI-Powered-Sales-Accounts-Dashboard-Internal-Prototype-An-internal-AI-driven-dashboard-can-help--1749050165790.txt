AI-Powered Sales & Accounts Dashboard (Internal Prototype)
An internal AI-driven dashboard can help a boutique investment research firm (like 13D Research) manage client accounts, leads, and content distribution more efficiently. By integrating 13D’s proprietary WILTW (“What I Learned This Week”) reports and sales data, the system automates routine tasks and tailors outreach. Below are four mock modules with example inputs/outputs, illustrating how the tool might function for sales and account teams.
Invoicing Assistant
Inputs (mock):
Client name: Acme Corp
Invoice amount: $15,000
Invoice sent date: 2025-05-15
Payment status: Overdue
Last email thread: "Sent invoice #12345 on 2025-05-15; no reply yet." (Mock)
Outputs:
GPT Follow-up Email (unpaid):
Subject: Overdue Invoice Reminder (Mock)
Body: Hello [Client Name], I hope you’re well. This is a friendly follow-up on invoice #12345 for $15,000 sent 20 days ago on 2025-05-15. We have not yet received payment. Could you please let us know if you need any further information or if there’s an updated payment date? Thank you for your prompt attention. (Mock)
(Automated draft email generated by AI to nudge payment)
Days Since Sent: 20 days (automatically calculated)
Status: Overdue
Reminder Logic: Flag and resend reminder after 7 days if unpaid. (For example, best practice is to send follow-ups at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, etc.
getjobber.com
.)
The Invoicing Assistant automatically tracks unpaid or overdue invoices and drafts polite reminder emails. It calculates days past due and can schedule the next reminder (e.g. in one week) based on common payment reminder intervals

Content Distribution Tracker
Inputs (mock):
Recent 13D reports sent: “WILTW #66 – Global Tech Trends (2025-05-10)”, “WILTW #65 – AI & Energy (2025-04-30)”
Report engagement stats: e.g. 60% open rate, 30% click-through on links (Mock)
Analyst call participation: Attended “Macro Roundtable” on 2025-05-08 (Mock)
Outreach notes: “Interested in clean energy and semiconductors” (Mock)
Outputs:
GPT-Generated Engagement Summary:
"Mock Summary: Client opened our 5/10 WILTW tech report (60% open rate) and clicked a link on chip shortages. They attended the 5/08 analyst call on energy. They did not open the WILTW on healthcare. Notes indicate interest in CleanTech and semiconductors." (Mock)
This personalized summary highlights what content the client engaged with (personalization boosts relevance and engagement
salesforce.com
).
Suggested Follow-up Topic: “AI Chips & Semiconductors” (Mock) – based on their clicks and interest tags.
AI Recommendation (message blurb):
"We noticed [Client] liked our technology and energy research. Suggest sending the latest WILTW on semiconductor trends to capture their interest. (Mock)"
(Automated suggestion for next content, ensuring messages align with client’s interests
salesforce.com
.)
Interest Tags: “CleanTech”, “Semiconductors” (derived from clicked articles and notes)
The Content Distribution Tracker uses client behavior (opens, clicks, call attendance) to tag interests and recommend topics. For example, since the client engaged with recent tech and energy reports, the AI suggests sending a follow-up report on semiconductors. By tailoring content to past interests, the system aims to increase engagement and conversions

Lead Pipeline Assistant
Inputs (mock):
Lead: Jane Doe (ABC Capital)
Current stage: Prospect – Intro Email Sent
Last outreach: Intro email on 2025-05-20 (Mock)
Next step (planned): Schedule discovery call
Prior notes: “Focuses on precious metals and emerging markets.” (Mock)
Outputs:
Pipeline Overview: Consolidated list of leads by stage/date (e.g. “Jane Doe – Stage: Discovery – Last Contact: 2025-05-20 – Next Step: Call”). The view is sortable and highlights at-risk leads (akin to CRM dashboards that flag pipeline health
salesforce.com
).
GPT-Suggested Next Step: “Send recent WILTW on gold prices and ask for a meeting to discuss implications” (Mock). (AI recommends next action; Salesforce AI uses CRM data for tailored next-step suggestions
salesforce.com
.)
Draft Intro/Follow-Up Email (GPT):
Subject: Introduction to 13D Research (Mock)
Body: Hello Jane, I’m [Your Name] at 13D Research. We specialize in deep-dive investment research on sectors like precious metals. I thought you might be interested in our recent WILTW report on gold market trends (attached). I’d love to schedule a brief call to discuss how these insights can support your strategy. (Mock)
(Automated email draft to engage the lead)
Proposal Reminder Option: A one-click button can draft or send reminder for pending proposals, e.g. “Friendly reminder to review our proposal.” (Mock)
The Lead Pipeline Assistant mirrors a CRM pipeline, tracking each lead’s stage and activities. It uses AI to prioritize actions – for example, suggesting to share relevant research when a lead shows interest. This is in line with AI sales tools that generate “best next actions” from CRM data

Follow-Up Generator
Inputs (mock):
Client: Beta Fund (renewal due)
Last emails:
Subject: “Next Steps for Our Research Partnership”, Body: “… looking forward to renewal.”
Subject: “Insights on AI Markets”, Body: “… enjoyed the AI report.”
Renewal status: Subscription expiring in 30 days (Mock)
Relevant WILTW reports: “WILTW #64 – AI Investing” (Mock)
Outputs:
GPT-Drafted Follow-Up:
Subject: Upcoming Subscription Renewal (Mock)
Body: Hello [Name], thank you for your continued partnership. I see your annual subscription ends soon. Based on our last conversation about AI investing, I’m sharing the latest WILTW on AI trends (attached). We’d love to discuss renewing your subscription and exploring our new Premium tier. Are you available for a quick call next week? (Mock)
(Renewal-oriented email draft with personalized touch from past topics)
Risk Level: Yellow (Mock) – indicates moderate renewal risk. The AI flags this because usage is high but renewal isn’t confirmed. (Predictive tools often calculate “revenue at risk” and alert teams to act before churn
legittai.com
.)
Talking Point/Theme: Emphasize ROI of premium content and highlight AI/tech market insights from the WILTW. (Mock)
Client Tag: “Upgrade Candidate” (Mock) – marked as good upgrade potential due to high engagement and upcoming renewal.
The Follow-Up Generator composes timely, personalized renewal or upsell messages. It assigns a simple risk indicator (Green/Yellow/Red) based on engagement and renewal data. For example, if usage is strong but renewal is pending, the client is “Yellow” (at risk of churn)

. The tool then suggests relevant talking points (e.g. new AI report insights) to encourage renewal or upgrades. Notes: This mock UI demonstrates how integrating 13D’s WILTW content into the workflow can personalize outreach. AI-generated outputs (marked Mock above) are tailored to client interests. Citations show that such personalized, AI-driven sales tools (flagging at-risk accounts
