Hi Monica,  

I hope you're doing well. Based on your interest in precious metals and geopolitics, I wanted to share a few quick insights from our latest 13D research that may be timely for your strategy:  

• Gold-to-CPI ratio just broke a 45-year downtrend, suggesting renewed strength in metals.  
• Silver miners (SIL, SILJ) are outperforming global indices by double digits.  
• USD under pressure as inflation expectations rise, boosting commodity tailwinds.  

At 13D, we're seeing a broad asset rotation toward hard assets and non-U.S. exposures. Our research provides early intelligence to help position portfolios before these shifts become consensus.  

Let me know if you would like me to send over some older relevant reports on topics of interest. 

Best regards,  
Spencer
