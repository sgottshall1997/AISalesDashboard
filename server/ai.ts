Reports: ${JSON.stringify(reportData)}

Based on the ACTUAL CONTENT from these reports, identify investment themes and market insights. Focus on:

1. FREQUENT THEMES - Investment topics that appear across multiple reports (commodities, paradigm shifts, market cycles, asset allocation)
2. EMERGING TRENDS - New market developments or investment opportunities mentioned in recent reports
3. CROSS-SECTOR CONNECTIONS - How different markets/sectors relate (precious metals, inflation, bonds, equities)
4. DEEP DIVE OPPORTUNITIES - Complex investment themes that warrant detailed follow-up analysis

IMPORTANT: Base suggestions ONLY on the actual content provided. Look for:
- Specific investment strategies mentioned
- Market commentary and predictions
- Asset allocation recommendations
- Economic themes and philosophical insights
- References to specific sectors, commodities, or markets

For each suggestion, provide:
- type: one of "frequent_theme", "emerging_trend", "cross_sector", "deep_dive"
- title: compelling email subject line focused on investment insights
- description: what specific investment angle the email would cover
- emailAngle: unique perspective based on the report content
- supportingReports: array of specific report titles containing this theme
- keyPoints: 3-4 specific insights from the reports
- priority: "high" for major investment themes, "medium" for sector-specific, "low" for general insights

2. A pre-selected content theme or angle, such as:
   - "The Power of Love and Suffering in Investment Decisions"
   - "The Rise of Commodities: A New Market Paradigm"

Your job is to:
- Scan all reports for content, data, or insights relevant to the chosen theme.
- Extract 2â€“4 key bullet points that support or exemplify the theme.
- Write a concise outreach email that opens with a hook aligned to the theme, summarizes 2â€“3 findings from the reports, and closes with an offer to share more material or discuss further.

Format the output as follows:

---

**ðŸ“© Email Output**

**Subject Line**: [Compelling subject related to theme]

**Body**:
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well. I thought you might appreciate a few insights from our latest reports, especially through the lens of *[insert theme]*:

â€¢ [Bullet Point #1 from report]
â€¢ [Bullet Point #2 from report]
â€¢ [Optional Bullet Point #3]

We're seeing this theme emerge more broadly across sectors and geographiesâ€”highlighting the kind of structural shifts that 13D is known for tracking early.

Let me know if you'd like me to send over a few more pieces that explore this further.

Best,  
Spencer

**Notes for GPT**:
- Keep the email under 250 words.
- Prioritize high-impact or counterintuitive insights from the reports.
- Maintain a professional, yet human toneâ€”this is going to a senior investor audience.`;
