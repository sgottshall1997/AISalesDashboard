3. GEOPOLITICAL INVESTMENTS - China markets, contrarian opportunities, global economic themes
4. DEEP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS - Complex financial strategies, portfolio allocation insights

For each theme found in the reports, create:
- type: "frequent_theme", "emerging_trend", "cross_sector", or "deep_dive"
- title: Professional email subject focused on investment opportunity
- description: Investment angle based on actual report content
- emailAngle: Specific market perspective from the reports
- supportingReports: Array of report titles that contain this theme
- keyPoints: 3-4 actual insights from the report content
- insights: Array of 2-3 specific, traceable facts from the source reports (quotable data points)
