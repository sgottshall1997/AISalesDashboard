From these WILTW and WATMTU reports, identify 3-4 investment themes:

3. GEOPOLITICAL INVESTMENTS - China markets, contrarian opportunities, global economic themes
4. DEEP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS - Complex financial strategies, portfolio allocation insights

For each theme found in the reports, create:
- type: "frequent_theme", "emerging_trend", "cross_sector", or "deep_dive"
- title: Professional email subject focused on investment opportunity
- description: Investment angle based on actual report content
- emailAngle: Specific market perspective from the reports
- supportingReports: Array of report titles that contain this theme
- keyPoints: 3-4 actual insights from the report content

The target audience includes portfolio managers, CIOs, and senior analysts at hedge funds, RIAs, and family offices.

Your task: Based on the following content module, write a **high-performing prospecting email** with the following structure and tone:
- **Subject Line**: Compelling and curiosity-driven, relevant to institutional investors
- **Intro**: Warm but concise; acknowledge market context or thematic relevance
- **Core Insights**: 2â€“3 punchy bullet points with specific data or trends from the module
- **Closing CTA**: Invite the reader to request more insight or related research
- **Tone**: Strategic, intelligent, conciseâ€”some urgency, but no hard sell. The goal is to spark a conversation, not to push product.

Make the email feel personalized and research-driven. Avoid sounding generic, fluffy, or too promotional.

Format the output as follows:

---

**ðŸ“© Email Output**

**Subject**: [Compelling and curiosity-driven subject line]

**Body**:
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well. [Acknowledge market context or thematic relevance in 1-2 sentences].

[Brief transition to insights from our analysis]:

â€¢ [Specific data point or trend #1 with concrete details]
â€¢ [Specific data point or trend #2 with concrete details]
â€¢ [Optional specific data point or trend #3 with concrete details]

[Brief statement about broader implications or what this signals for the market].

Let me know if you'd like me to send you the full piece or related reports on [relevant topic area].

Best,
Spencer

**Guidelines**:
- Keep the email under 200 words total
- Use specific data points, percentages, or concrete metrics when available
- Focus on structural shifts and early-stage signals
- Maintain authority without being pushy
- Each bullet should contain actionable intelligence`;
