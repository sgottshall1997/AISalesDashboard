REPORT ANALYSIS DATA:
${JSON.stringify(reportData)}

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus PRIMARILY on investment themes from the actual report content and analysis
- Extract key insights and findings from the parsed summaries
- Create suggestions based on research insights and market analysis
- Only briefly mention relevant HC portfolio positioning where it directly supports the theme (top holdings: ${topHoldings.join(', ')})
- Prioritize research content over portfolio references

From these WILTW and WATMTU reports, identify 3-4 investment themes based on the research analysis:

1. COMMODITIES & INFLATION - Analysis from reports on precious metals, commodities markets, inflation hedges
2. MARKET PARADIGM SHIFTS - Research insights on new market leaders, sector rotations, asset allocation changes  
3. GEOPOLITICAL INVESTMENTS - Report analysis on China markets, contrarian opportunities, global economic themes
4. DEEP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS - Complex financial strategies and portfolio insights from research

For each theme found in the reports, create:
- type: "frequent_theme", "emerging_trend", "cross_sector", or "deep_dive"
- title: Professional email subject focused on the research insight
- description: Investment angle based primarily on report content with minimal portfolio reference
- emailAngle: Specific market perspective from the research analysis
- supportingReports: Array of report titles that contain this theme
- keyPoints: 3-4 actual insights from the report content with brief portfolio validation where relevant
- insights: Array of 2-3 specific, traceable facts from source reports
- priority: "high", "medium", or "low" (prioritize based on research depth and insight quality)
