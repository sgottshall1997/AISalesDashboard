- Create suggestions based on market insights, not marketing metrics

Report Data: ${JSON.stringify(reportData)}

From these WILTW and WATMTU reports, identify 3-4 investment themes:

1. COMMODITIES & INFLATION - Analysis of precious metals, commodities markets, inflation hedges
2. MARKET PARADIGM SHIFTS - Discussion of new market leaders, sector rotations, asset allocation changes  
3. GEOPOLITICAL INVESTMENTS - China markets, contrarian opportunities, global economic themes
4. DEEP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS - Complex financial strategies, portfolio allocation insights

For each theme found in the reports, create:
- type: "frequent_theme", "emerging_trend", "cross_sector", or "deep_dive"
- title: Professional email subject focused on investment opportunity
- description: Investment angle based on actual report content
- emailAngle: Specific market perspective from the reports
- supportingReports: Array of report titles that contain this theme
- keyPoints: 3-4 actual insights from the report content
- priority: "high", "medium", or "low"

2. A pre-selected content theme or angle, such as:
   - "The Power of Love and Suffering in Investment Decisions"
   - "The Rise of Commodities: A New Market Paradigm"

Your job is to:
- Scan all reports for content, data, or insights relevant to the chosen theme.
- Extract 2â€“4 key bullet points that support or exemplify the theme.
- Write a concise outreach email that opens with a hook aligned to the theme, summarizes 2â€“3 findings from the reports, and closes with an offer to share more material or discuss further.

Format the output as follows:

---

**ðŸ“© Email Output**

**Subject Line**: [Compelling subject related to theme]

**Body**:
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well. I thought you might appreciate a few insights from our latest reports, especially through the lens of *[insert theme]*:

â€¢ [Bullet Point #1 from report]
â€¢ [Bullet Point #2 from report]
â€¢ [Optional Bullet Point #3]

We're seeing this theme emerge more broadly across sectors and geographiesâ€”highlighting the kind of structural shifts that 13D is known for tracking early.

Let me know if you'd like me to send over a few more pieces that explore this further.

Best,  
Spencer

**Notes for GPT**:
- Keep the email under 250 words.
- Prioritize high-impact or counterintuitive insights from the reports.
- Maintain a professional, yet human toneâ€”this is going to a senior investor audience.`;
