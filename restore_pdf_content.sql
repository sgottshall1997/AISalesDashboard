Whenever God means to make you great, He always breaks you in pieces first. Charles Spurgeon

Engrave this upon thy heart: There isn''t anyone you couldn''t love once you''ve heard their story. Mary Lou Kownacki

Only people who are capable of loving strongly, can also suffer great sorrow; but this same necessity of loving serves to counteract their grief and heal them. Leo Tolstoy

Three passions have governed my life: The longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of humankind. Bertrand Russell

All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. Helen Keller

His eyes had about them an innocence that no suffering could touch, neither the hardness of this country nor the malignancy of men... "What happened to him during the bad times when you left, when the temples were destroyed, when the people starved?" "He is a monk and that is enough. They beat him but he doesn''t care. If they knock him down he stands again and blesses them. He has only compassion for them, only love and sadness for the world." George Crane, Bones of the Master: A Journey to Secret Mongolia

Till I loved I never lived. Emily Dickinson

What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism. Albert Einstein

You must go on. I can''t go on. I''ll go on. Samuel Beckett, The Unnamable

One lives so long to learn so little. Louis L''Amour

In the end these things matter most: How well did you love? How fully did you live? How deeply did you let go? Siddhartha Gautama

Happiness is beneficial for the body but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind. Marcel Proust

Suffering is what happens when you have an argument with reality. Buddhist Wisdom

A stout man''s heart breaks bad luck. Miguel de Cervantes

STRATEGY & ASSET ALLOCATION & PERFORMANCE OF HIGH CONVICTION IDEAS

Since September 2020, we have strongly and repeatedly argued that a classic paradigm shift into the new market leaders was starting, which would feature commodities, commodity-related and inflation-sensitive sectors, and many of the long-depressed markets.

In October 2020, with UST 10-year yields at 0.78%, we warned that bond yields would rise significantly and for a long time as the 40-year bull market in bonds transitions to a secular bear market.

For the past two years, the great question among Western investors has been: "Is China uninvestable?" As long-term contrarians, that is music to our ears! We believe Chinese stocks are in the early stages of a secular bull market.

Other important recent developments that support the basis for our high conviction themes:

The ratio of gold to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) broke-out last September from a 45-year downtrend-line.

The outperformance of the gold miners versus the major U.S. stock market indices is breaking-out, as suggested by rising bond market inflation expectations.

Sensitive inflation indicators in the markets are starting to come alive.

The U.S. Dollar appears to be entering a long-term downtrend, which is bullish for commodities and inflation.

Silver is starting to outperform gold. And the relative-performance of the silver miners has broken-out against almost every broad stock-market index in the world.

Agricultural commodities and related-stocks are starting to rise, as several agriculture ETFs and fertilizer stocks have broken-out.

These developments lead to the following conclusions:
1. Gold is set to outperform the S&P 500 and international stock-markets.
2. The shift toward hard assets is likely to gain further momentum.
3. China''s stock-market could be among the best-performing markets in the world.

The Highest Conviction ideas reflect this view, with the following major allocations:
Gold, silver and their mining-stocks 35.5%
Commodities and related-sectors 23.0%
Chinese equity markets 15.0%

Over the past week, 13D Highest Conviction Ideas portfolio gained by +1.4%, compared to the gains of +0.8% and +0.5% in the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index, respectively. The key contributors included the 13D Uranium Index (+13.8%), 13D Copper Strategy (+5.6%), 13D Water Index (+2.4%), 13D Defense Index (+2.1%), 13D Gold Miners Index (+1.2%), 13D Silver Strategy (+1.1%), 13D Food Security Index (+0.9%), 13D Oil & Gas Index (+0.9%), and the 13D Gold HGAX Index (+0.8%). However, the HSCEI (-2.5%), HSI (-2.2%), Bitcoin (-1.8%), 13D China Deep Value & HDY Index (-0.9%), Gold Bullion (-0.8%), 13D Market Extremes Dynamic Strategy (-0.8%), and the 13D Non-U.S. Markets Index (-0.6%) detracted from the overall gains.

Year-to-date, 13D Highest Conviction Ideas portfolio has risen by 19.6%, which is outperforming the S&P 500 by 18.9% and the MSCI World Index by 14.9%.

China''s weaponization of the critical-minerals supply chain, particularly rare-earth elements, is the most important yet least understood risk to the U.S. economy and national security. Even with the trade-war truce this month, China has not fully lifted its rare-earth export restrictions. The manufacturing of several strategically-essential products could still come to a complete halt within a short period. What are the implications?

Since 2016, we''ve written over 50 articles arguing that the U.S.-China tech-arms race will shape 21st-century leadership (see WILTW reports). We have also argued that critical minerals will take center stage in the new U.S. administration (see WILTW reports). A Govini report notes that China''s export ban on antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten, and tellurium alone threatens 78% of U.S. weapons production. BCG predicts that China''s export controls on rare-earth elements (REEs) will disrupt U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in 2025/2026, resulting in production delays, capacity constraints, and increased costs. The complexity and time required to bring a new mine online, combined with the unavailability of refining and processing technology at scale and record-low stockpiles in America, raises a crucial question: How would the U.S. fulfill domestic demand if China implemented a complete export ban?

A recent Foreign Affairs article compares today''s situation to World War II, when the U.S. became overly dependent on imports of critical minerals, despite warnings about supply-chain vulnerabilities for a decade. President Franklin Roosevelt transferred control of the stockpile to the private sector, which scoured the globe to buy or barter for resources at any cost. However, unlike in 1940, America''s current key military adversary is the same country that dominates the supply of critical minerals, including REEs, which are essential to the modern economy and national security.

At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense determined that 99% of its strategic minerals and rare-earth elements stockpile was no longer required. As a result, they liquidated the facility and adopted a just-in-time approach to global sourcing. Over the following 30 years, Washington''s complacency and Beijing''s strategy to invest in its critical-minerals industry from mine-to-market enabled China to establish a dominant global-mining presence and nearly monopolize refining technology. The EU still doesn''t have a critical-minerals stockpile.

Disruptions to the West''s supply of REEs originating in China could lead to a commodity shock affecting several key industries. REEs are deeply embedded in the modern economic sectors, including defense, semiconductors, clean energy technologies, robotics, fiber optics, and lasers, among others. For instance, precision-guided ballistic missiles, favored by the U.S. Army, utilize magnets containing REEs to rotate the tail fins, which enables the missiles to home in on small or moving targets. REE permanent magnets are indispensable in the compact electric motors of high-tech military drones. Similarly, the unavailability of Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) could jeopardize modern gas-turbine production, hindering the meeting of electricity demand. One European Commission report identified 53 supply-chain steps across 15 technologies and five sectors it considers vulnerable to disruption on the continent.

The tariff war initiated by the Trump Administration has led to the suspension of China''s export of heavy rare-earth elements (HREEs), including permanent magnets and all end-use products that contain the seven restricted heavy rare-earth elements. When processed, rare earths then make up the permanent magnets that underpin several key global industries. REEs and permanent magnets use is expanding in many modern technologies, including drones, wind turbines, EVs, computers, lasers, and radar systems. We noted in the WILTW May 8, 2025, that without rare earths, there are no permanent magnets. Without permanent magnets, there is no industry.

According to the Geneva trade statement on May 12, America''s tariffs on Chinese imports will be 30%, down from 145%, while China lowered its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. However, China will continue to require licenses for exporting medium- and heavy-REEs on the restriction list, namely samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. These de-escalation attempts have essentially excluded any relief in China''s REE exports, underscoring that it is the Middle Kingdom''s "ace in the hand," given their deep integration into the U.S. economy and national security.

Beijing''s new licensing system empowers China to impact global supply chains of nearly all high-tech products headed to Western industrialized nations. The licensing system introduced last month requires domestic companies to get approval from the government to export REE oxides, alloys, and magnets. So far, China has issued only two export licenses, one for Europe and another for Vietnam. The permits are granted under a "one batch, one license" rule, requiring a new permit for each shipment.

Last week, President Trump announced plans to impose new "reciprocal" tariffs by sending letters to countries. The initial 90-day negotiating period has thus far yielded only two deals, with China and the U.K., neither of which has resulted in a final agreement. A recent article by the Hinrich Foundation noted that the Trump Administration''s nearly 50 policy changes within its first 100 days have caused considerable uncertainty among trading partners, particularly in Asia.

The Trump Administration''s "asks" list is long and complicated for the nations. It includes the request to reduce Chinese content in their products to continue trading with the U.S. Given the deep supply-chain connections and China''s extensive regional investments, these requests are very challenging. Failure to reach a trade deal with China, before the 90-day reprieve expires, could provoke retaliatory tariffs and the escalation of China''s REE supply-chain weaponization. A complete export ban on REEs would risk numerous manufacturing-production lines across various industries grinding to a halt.

The world is in uncharted territory of geopolitical fragility, with globally interdependent supply chains more complex than ever, and REE sourcing being arguably the most-critical single point of failure for Western nations.

Consider the following:

China mines approximately 70% of global REEs and refines and processes 85% of the world''s total. China''s grip on REEs is most notable with heavy REEs, controlling 100% of worldwide supply. Furthermore, China manufactures roughly 90% of the 200,000 tons of REE magnets produced annually. Japan and Germany produce small quantities, but they depend on China for raw materials.

According to the latest "Critical Minerals Summary" report, America is 100% net import-reliant for 12 critical minerals and over 50% net-import-reliant for an additional 28, including 14 lanthanides, which are listed under REEs. The U.S. imports over 95% of its REE consumption. China is the primary supplier, creating a significant supply-chain vulnerability.

The declining critical-mineral stockpiles in Western countries are concerning. Citing a recent analysis by consulting firm AlixPartners, Digitimes reported that primary suppliers in the EU and U.S. currently hold only four to six weeks of REE inventory. For instance, the U.S. currently has no gallium inventory and stocks only half of its annual germanium consumption. The two semiconductor minerals are vital for military electronics and other defense applications.

The latest "National Defense Stockpile" report prepared by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which includes critical minerals and other required raw materials, concluded that the items in short supply increased by 167% from 2019 to 2023. As of March 2023, U.S. stockpile inventories of 15 critical materials fell below the goal quantities set by the DoD.

The "missing link" in the AI tech-arms race: advanced digital-telecom infrastructure and why it is the deciding factor in determining which country leads in AI deployment. What are the implications? How to invest.

The race for AI supremacy between the U.S. and China has intensified dramatically, but a critical factor determining the winner is often overlooked: advanced digital telecommunications infrastructure. While much attention focuses on semiconductor capabilities, computing power, and AI algorithms, the underlying digital infrastructure - particularly 5G networks, edge computing capabilities, and fiber-optic backbone systems - represents the decisive battleground.

China has made substantial investments in digital infrastructure that give it significant advantages in AI deployment at scale. China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom have deployed the world''s largest 5G networks, covering over 95% of the population with ultra-low latency connections essential for real-time AI applications. This infrastructure advantage enables China to deploy AI systems across manufacturing, logistics, urban management, and consumer applications at unprecedented scale.

The implications for investment are profound. Companies building the digital infrastructure backbone - fiber optic networks, 5G equipment, edge computing facilities, and data centers - represent critical investment opportunities. Key players include Corning (fiber optics), American Tower Corporation (telecommunications infrastructure), Digital Realty Trust (data centers), and Schneider Electric (edge computing solutions).

The "missing link" insight reveals that AI leadership isn''t just about having the most advanced chips or algorithms - it''s about having the infrastructure to deploy AI at scale across entire economies. This creates investment opportunities in infrastructure companies that enable AI deployment rather than just AI development.

Why are mining stocks broadly outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year? One answer: The challenge of reshoring U.S. industrial supply chains is being laid bare by the decades of underinvestment in mining, not to mention the loss of skilled labor and new engineering talent. A double bottom has formed in this compelling mining stock.

The mining sector''s outperformance reflects fundamental supply-demand imbalances created by decades of underinvestment. As U.S. manufacturing seeks to reshore critical supply chains, particularly in semiconductors, clean energy, and defense technologies, the shortage of domestic mining capacity has become apparent.

Copper, silver, lithium, and rare earth elements are experiencing supply constraints precisely when demand is accelerating due to electrification trends and reshoring initiatives. Mining companies with proven reserves and production capabilities are benefiting from this structural shift.

Foran Mining Corporation presents a compelling investment opportunity, having formed a double bottom pattern around CAD $2.50. The company''s McIlvenna Bay project in Saskatchewan contains significant copper and zinc reserves, positioning it to benefit from both electrification trends and North American supply chain reshoring. With copper prices trending higher and limited new mine supply coming online, Foran represents exposure to critical minerals essential for the energy transition.

The investment thesis centers on scarcity value - North America lacks sufficient mining capacity to support reshoring ambitions, creating opportunities for companies with quality assets and operational capabilities.

What happened when four teenagers gave up their phones for 100 days to attend a remote, sustainable school in The Bahamas? (Continued)

This experiment in digital detox and sustainable living provides insights into behavioral changes that could influence long-term consumption patterns and investment themes. The teenagers'' experience suggests potential shifts away from technology dependence toward experiential and sustainable consumption.

This behavioral shift has implications for investment in companies focused on outdoor recreation, sustainable products, and experiential services rather than pure technology consumption.

Loneliness, which is sweeping across the world, is perhaps the world''s least-understood investment theme (continued). We maintain our bullish stance on our favorite Chinese pet-supply companies, which have returned 226% since our initial recommendation in August 2019.

The loneliness epidemic, particularly acute in developed economies and urban China, continues driving demand for companion animals and related products. Chinese pet ownership has exploded as urbanization and delayed family formation increase social isolation.

Yantai China Pet Foods Co. and Petpal Pet Nutrition Technology represent our core holdings in this theme, having delivered exceptional returns as Chinese pet ownership rates approach Western levels. The companies benefit from premiumization trends as pet owners increasingly treat animals as family members, driving demand for higher-quality nutrition and care products.

The investment opportunity extends beyond pet food to veterinary services, pet insurance, and premium pet accessories as the Chinese pet economy matures.

In the last fortnight, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and Mario Draghi have sought to undermine the U.S. dollar''s reserve status and are working to position the euro as an alternative. Here is how this might play out.

European officials have accelerated efforts to establish euro-denominated payment systems and reduce dollar dependence in international trade. The ECB''s digital euro initiative, combined with expanded euro clearing capabilities, represents a coordinated challenge to dollar hegemony.

This shift could benefit European financial institutions and create opportunities in euro-denominated assets as central banks diversify reserves. However, the dollar''s entrenchment in global trade and finance systems suggests any transition would be gradual and potentially volatile.

Investment implications include potential strength in European banks, increased volatility in currency markets, and opportunities in companies facilitating alternative payment systems.

The enduring wisdom of Aesop''s fables provides timeless lessons about human nature, patience, and the consequences of shortsighted behavior - lessons particularly relevant for long-term investors navigating market cycles and geopolitical uncertainty.

Why do so many analysts get Russia wrong? Most analysis fails to account for Russia''s resource wealth, technological capabilities in defense and energy sectors, and strategic patience in geopolitical maneuvering. This analytical blind spot creates opportunities for investors who can assess Russian-related investments more accurately.

Europe''s agricultural production is stagnating due to frequent droughts and water shortages. This increases Europe''s reliance on food imports from other countries that are also struggling with the impacts of extreme weather. What are the implications?

Climate-driven agricultural challenges in Europe create investment opportunities in water management technologies, drought-resistant crop development, and alternative protein sources. Companies developing irrigation efficiency, desalination, and precision agriculture technologies stand to benefit from increasing water scarcity.

The shift toward food security as a national priority also creates opportunities in agricultural technology companies and alternative protein producers as traditional farming faces climate constraints.'
